This is my personal website. I am a third-year PhD student in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds, UK.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
