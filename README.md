This is my personal website. I am about to conclude my PhD in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds, UK.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
