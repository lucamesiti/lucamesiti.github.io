# Luca Mesiti

This is my personal website. I am a postdoc in Category Theory, Mathematics, at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. My main research interests are category theory and its applications to algebra, geometry and logic. In particular, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction, 2-categories, categorical algebra, enriched categories and topos theory.
