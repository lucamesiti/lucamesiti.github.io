This is my personal website. I am a PostDoc in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. My main research interests are category theory and its applications to logic, algebra and geometry, as well as to physics and computer science. In particular, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction, 2-categories, categorical algebra, enriched categories and topos theory.
