This is my personal website. I am about to conclude my PhD in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds, UK.

My main research interests are category theory and its applications to logic, geometry, algebra and computer science. More precisely, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction, 2-category theory, enriched category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
