This is my personal website. I am a PostDoc in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. My main research interests are category theory and its applications to logic, algebra, geometry and computer science. In particular, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction, 2-category theory, enriched category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.
