Joint work with Elena Caviglia and Amartya Goswami.

We generalize Jacobson's notion of primitive ring to the setting of quantales. We show that every primitive ring gives rise to a primitive quantale of ideals. We then prove a density theorem for strongly primitive quantales. Furthermore, we show that primitive quantales are prime and commutative strongly primitive quantales are field quantales.
