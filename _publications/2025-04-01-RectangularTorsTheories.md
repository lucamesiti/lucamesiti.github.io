Joint work with Elena Caviglia and Zurab Janelidze.

In this paper we introduce and study rectangular torsion theories, i.e. those torsion theories (C,T,F) with C a pointed category, where the canonical functor C->TxF is an equivalence of categories. In particular, we show that these are precisely the internal rectangular bands in the 2-category of pointed categories.
