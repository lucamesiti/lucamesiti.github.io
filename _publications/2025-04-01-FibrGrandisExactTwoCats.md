Joint work with Elena Caviglia and Zurab Janelidze.

In an abelian category, the (bi)fibration of subobjects is isomorphic to the (bi)fibration of quotients. This property captures a substantial information about the exactness structure of a category. Indeed, as it was shown by the second author and Weighill, categories equipped with a proper factorization system such that the opfibration of subobjects relative to the factorization system is isomorphic to the fibration of relative quotients are precisely the Grandis exact categories. Motivated by on-going work of the second author with Ãœlo Reimaa, indicating that the 2-category of abelian categories (with suitably chosen morphisms) satisfies some 2-dimensional exactness conditions, in this paper we propose a 2-dimensional notion of a Grandis exact category. We reach such definition as an outcome of characterizing those (1,1)-proper factorization systems on a 2-category in the sense of Dupont and Vitale, for which the weak 2-opfibration of relative 2-subobjects is biequivalent to the weak 2-fibration of relative 2-quotients.
