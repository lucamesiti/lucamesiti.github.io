We generalize to dimension 2 the well-known fact that a colimit in a 1-dimensional slice is precisely the map from the colimit of the domains of the diagram that is induced by the universal property. For this, we find the need to reduce weighted 2-colimits to cartesian-marked oplax conical ones, and as a consequence the need to consider lax slices. We prove results of preservation, reflection and lifting of 2-colimits for the domain 2-functor from a lax slice. We thus generalize to dimension 2 the whole fruitful calculus of colimits in 1-dimensional slices. We achieve this within the framework of enhanced (or F-)category theory. The preservation result assumes products in the base 2-category and uses an original general theorem which states that a lax left adjoint preserves appropriate 2-colimits if the adjunction is strict on one side and suitably F-categorical. Finally, we apply the same general theorem of preservation of 2-colimits to the 2-functor of change of base along a split Grothendieck opfibration between lax slices. We prove that this change of base 2-functor is indeed a left adjoint of the kind described above by laxifying the proof that Conduch\'{e} functors are exponentiable. We conclude extending the result of preservation of 2-colimits for the change of base 2-functor to any finitely complete 2-category with a dense generator.
