title: "The 2-Set-enriched Grothendieck construction and the lax normal conical 2-limits"
collection: publications
permalink: #/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We study in detail an extended version of the Grothendieck construction, that corresponds to a 2-categorical generalization of the construction of the category of elements. After refining the universal property of the lax comma object to suit the lax 3-categorical ambient in which we need to work, we describe how we can think of this extended Grothendieck construction as the archetypal 3-dimensional classification process, in the sense of a would-be 3-dimensional elementary topos theory. We show a new, more intuitive and elementary proof of the reduction of the weighted 2-limits to essentially conical ones, and use a generalized version of the latter to propose an original definition of pointwise Kan extension in the weakly enriched context that hosts the studied Grothendieck construction. We then present a pointwise Kan extension result, and we conclude by proving that a pointwise Kan extension as defined here is always a weak one as well, after showing a lax but not too lax generalization of the parametrized Yoneda lemma.'

We study in detail an extended version of the Grothendieck construction, that corresponds to a 2-categorical generalization of the construction of the category of elements. After refining the universal property of the lax comma object to suit the lax 3-categorical ambient in which we need to work, we describe how we can think of this extended Grothendieck construction as the archetypal 3-dimensional classification process, in the sense of a would-be 3-dimensional elementary topos theory.
We show a new, more intuitive and elementary proof of the reduction of the weighted 2-limits to essentially conical ones, and use a generalized version of the latter to propose an original definition of pointwise Kan extension in the weakly enriched context that hosts the studied Grothendieck construction.
We then present a pointwise Kan extension result, and we conclude by proving that a pointwise Kan extension as defined here is always a weak one as well, after showing a lax but not too lax generalization of the parametrized Yoneda lemma.
