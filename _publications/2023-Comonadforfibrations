title: "A Comonad for Grothendieck Fibrations"
collection: publications
permalink: #/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We study the 2-category theory of Grothendieck fibrations in the 2-category of functors Cat^2. After redrawing a few general results in that context, we show that fibrations over a given base are pseudo-coalgebras for a 2-comonad on Cat/B. We use that result to explain how an arbitrary fibration is equivalent to one with a splitting.'

We study the 2-category theory of Grothendieck fibrations in the 2-category of functors Cat^2. After redrawing a few general results in that context, we show that fibrations over a given base are pseudo-coalgebras for a 2-comonad on Cat/B. We use that result to explain how an arbitrary fibration is equivalent to one with a splitting.
