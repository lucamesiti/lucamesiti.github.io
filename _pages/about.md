My email address is mmlme@leeds.ac.uk

I am about to conclude my PhD in category theory at the School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds, UK, under the supervision of Nicola Gambino. I visited the University of Genova, Italy, from August 2023 to October 2023. Before, I visited the University of Manchester, UK, from September 2022 to August 2023.

My main research interests are category theory and its applications to logic, geometry and computer science. More precisely, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction, 2-category theory, enriched category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi.

During my PhD, I have been working on 2-classifiers, that are a 2-categorical generalization of subobject classifiers and can be thought of as Grothendieck constructions inside a 2-category. I proved that 2-categorical Grothendieck topoi have a 2-classifier. This also involved reducing the conditions of a 2-classifier to dense generators, studying colimits in 2-dimensional slices, an indexed Grothendieck construction and an essential conicalization of weighted 2-limits.

I am very passionate about research and I am a positive person who always smiles. I value love, truth and communication. In my free time, I like travelling as well as creating and playing board games.
