My email address is mmlme@leeds.ac.uk

I am a third-year PhD student in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the University of Leeds, UK (School of Mathematics), under the supervision of Nicola Gambino. I visited the University of Manchester, UK, from September 2022 to August 2023. I am currently visiting the University of Genova, Italy.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi. I am also interested in applying category theory to logic, geometry and computer science. 

I like creating and playing board games as a hobby.
