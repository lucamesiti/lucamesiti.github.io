My email address is mmlme@leeds.ac.uk

I am a third-year PhD student in Category Theory, Mathematics, at the University of Leeds, UK (School of Mathematics), under the supervision of Nicola Gambino. I am currently visiting the University of Manchester, UK.

My main research interests are the Grothendieck construction and its generalizations, enriched category theory, 2-category theory and 2-categorical elementary topoi. Look at the Research section if you are interested in my contributions.

I like creating and playing board games as a hobby.
