My email address is luca.mesiti@outlook.com

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematics division of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, working on category theory and its applications to algebra, pointfree topology and gravity theory. I am currently visiting Stellenbosch University, South Africa.

In July 2024 I obtained my PhD in category theory at the University of Leeds, UK, under the supervision of Nicola Gambino.<br /> I was a teaching assistant of the Adjoint School 2024 for Dorette Pronk's project on double fibrations. I visited the University of Genova, Italy, from August 2023 to October 2023. Before that, I visited the University of Manchester, UK, from September 2022 to August 2023.<br />

My main research interests are category theory and its applications to logic, algebra and geometry, as well as to physics and computer science.<br /> In particular, I have a keen interest in fibrations and the Grothendieck construction,<br /> 2-categories, categorical algebra, enriched categories and topos theory.

My PhD thesis contributed to expand 2-categorical elementary topos theory. In particular, I presented a novel technique of reduction of the study of 2-classifiers to dense generators.<br /> I then applied it to generalize to dimension 2 the fundamental result that Grothendieck topoi are elementary topoi. In order to reach my main theorems, I produced an original calculus of colimits in 2-dimensional slices and an indexed version of the Grothendieck construction.

I am very passionate about research and I am a positive person who always smiles. I value love, truth and communication.<br /> In my free time, I like travelling as well as creating and playing board games.
